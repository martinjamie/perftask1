<h1>Adventures in Tuscany</h1>
<p>This is a short chronicle of my visit to Italy. Click on the thumbnails to see a larger view of each photograph. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Pozzarello</h2>
<p><a href="window.html"><img src="thumbnails/window_thumb.jpg" alt="view from the bedroom window" width="75" height="100"></a> The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the year 1200 as the home of the gardner who tended the grounds of the adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us nice and cool inside, despite the blistering mid-day heat. This is the view from our bedroom window.</p>

<h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>
<p><a href="countryside.html"><img src="thumbnails/countryside_thumb.jpg" alt="view of the countryside" width="100" height="75"></a> This is the scene on the way to Montalcino (all roads lead to Montalcino!). It looks a lot like the scene on the way to Sienna, and the scene on the way to the grocery store. We were surrounded by beautiful countryside for most of our travels.</p>

<h2>Sienna</h2>
<p><a href="sienna.html"><img src="thumbnails/sienna_thumb.jpg" alt="the streets of sienna" width="75" height="100"></a> The closest city to our villa was Sienna, about 30 minutes away. We spent many days exploring the steep and crooked streets, sampling the local cuisine at outdoor restaurants, and stopping in the dark and echoey Duomo to escape the sun.</p>

<h2>Cathedral</h2>
<p><a href="cathedral.html"><img src="thumbnails/cathedral_thumb.jpg" alt="view of cathedral church" width="75" height="100"></a>  This is the cathedral church, countless pilgrims have come to honor the saint's sacrifice and offer their prayers at his shrine and they still come in their thousands today.</p>

<h2>Lavender</h2>
<p><a href="lavender.html"><img src="thumbnails/lavender_thumb.jpg" alt="beautiful lavender" width="75" height="100"></a> While purple is the color of royalty, and pink the color of youth, lavender is femininity all grown up. Thes are the pictures of the beautiful lavenders captured in italy the smell of these flowers are so good they are like perfume that you might wanna smell on the clothes. </p>

<h2>Sweets</h2>
<p><a href="sweets.html"><img src="thumbnails/sweets_thumb.jpg" alt="Yummy Desserts" width="100" height="75"></a> These are some of the dessert that we eat.Just like in the Philippines in the dessert list they have chocolate cake, pies and other yummy sweets. The sweets in italy are the best! </p>
